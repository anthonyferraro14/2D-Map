# 2D-Map
This generates a tile grid of different biomes that a user can navigate. A mini-map is also included, as well as keybinds for movement(WASD), regeneration(R), and exiting(Esc.)

CURRECT BUGS / ISSUES
----------------------

>> Within the 4-way directional movement, vertical movement is prioritized. 
    >> **Must change this to last key input & change from 4-directional [N/S/E/W] to 8-directional [NE/NW/SE/SW][N/S/E/W] movement**
>> Implement Zoom in/out feature; toggle mini-map(currently not needed; map size is too small)
>> Improve performance before expanding map size.
>> Add a toggle for a color-coded key, for what each tile represents
